Front-end web frameworks have won victories against us, technically, socially and emotionally. But we do not despair! After 5 weeks of learning we embarked on a new challenge: Create the best dating app using the Star Wars API in 24 hours. So with love, we present to you - Yoder: Intergalactic Dating, which was developed in one day only by yours truly: Matilde Ribeiro, Carolina Viero and Edward Watson. May the force be with you."
